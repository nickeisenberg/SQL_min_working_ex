## About
The goal of this repo is to help people get practice with SQL. There are plenty
of online resources for this however, this repo will allow you practice on your
own machine, %100 locally. The generation of a database will give the user the
opportunity to become familiar with

* Python and SQL integration,
* SQLAlchemy,
* creation of a SQL server, ie mysql, postgresql, sqlite, etc.,
* connection the SQL to SQLAlchemy through engines,
* SQL syntax.

Often the case, online tutorial-sites have a built-in SQL interpreter and so 
only the last bullet point above is addressed. Below are the listed
subdirectories that correspond to a database generator.

## Current database generators
1. parents_and_children

In each of the subdirectories, there will be a `create.py` file that contains
a `Create` class. This class will be used to generate the database. More 
details about this `Create` class are given in each subdirectory. Moreover,
there are some questions listed in each subdirectory that you can choose to do 
for practice.
